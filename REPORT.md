## 1. Foundational Concepts

To understand how ATLAS works, we first need to understand the underlying physics and the AI methodology used to solve the problem.

### 1.1 The Physics of Wind Energy

#### The Power Curve

A wind turbine does not generate power linearly with wind speed. Its output is defined by a **power curve** with three key regions:

| Region | Parameter | Value (Example) | Description |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Cut-in Speed** | $v_{in}$ | 3.0 m/s | Minimum wind speed for power generation |
| **Rated Speed** | $v_{rated}$ | 13.0 m/s | Speed at maximum power output |
| **Cut-out Speed** | $v_{out}$ | 25.0 m/s | Maximum safe operating speed |

In our simulation (see `_get_power` method), we model the power between the cut-in and rated speeds using a simplified cubic relationship:

$P = P_{rated} \times \left( \frac{v - v_{in}}{v_{rated} - v_{in}} \right)^3$

#### The Wake Effect

The wake effect is the primary problem ATLAS solves. As a turbine extracts energy from the wind, it leaves a "wake" of slower, more turbulent air behind it. Any turbine placed in this wake will receive less wind and generate significantly less power. 

**Goal:** Arrange turbines to minimize wake interactions and maximize total energy production.

---

### 1.2 The Jensen Wake Model

We implemented the **Jensen Wake Model**, a foundational model in wind energy engineering, to simulate wake effects. It assumes the wake expands linearly in a cone shape behind the turbine.

#### Key Calculations

**1. Wake Radius** at downwind distance $x$:

$R_{wake} = R_{rotor} + k \times x$

where $k = 0.05$ (wake expansion coefficient)

**2. Velocity Deficit** for turbines within the wake cone:

$\delta v = \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{R_{rotor}}{R_{wake}} \right)^2$

**3. Final Wind Speed** at downstream turbine:

$v_{final} = v_{initial} \times (1 - \delta v)$

**4. Multiple Wake Combination** - When affected by multiple upstream turbines, deficits are combined using:

$\delta v_{total} = \sqrt{\sum_{i} \delta v_i^2}$

---

### 1.3 The Mathematics of Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a field of AI where an **agent** learns to make decisions by performing **actions** in an **environment** to maximize cumulative **reward**.

#### Actor-Critic Architecture

Our implementation uses an **Actor-Critic** architecture with two neural networks:

| Network | Role | Input | Output |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| **Actor** (Policy) | Decision-maker | Current state (turbine layout) | Action (x, y coordinates) |
| **Critic** (Value Function) | Judge | State + Action | Q-value (expected future reward) |

**Learning Mechanism:** The Actor adjusts its policy based on feedback from the Critic, which evaluates the quality of each action.

#### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

DDPG is our chosen Actor-Critic algorithm, designed for continuous action spaces. Key features:

- **Replay Buffer**: Memory bank storing past experiences `(state, action, reward, next_state)` for stable learning through random mini-batch sampling
- **Target Networks**: Slow-moving copies of Actor and Critic networks providing stable learning objectives

## 2. Codebase Deep Dive

This section breaks down the key components of the source code.

### 2.1 `environment.py`: The Simulation Core

The `WindFarmEnv` class is the heart of the simulation, implementing the wind farm environment as an OpenAI Gym-compatible interface.

    """
    
    def __init__(self, terrain_path, wind_data_path, config):
        """Initialize environment with terrain data, wind data, and configuration."""
        super().__init__()
        
        # Load and store configuration
        self.config = config

        self.min_distance = env_config['min_distance_rotors'] * self.rotor_diameter

        # Define RL spaces
        self.action_space = spaces.Box(

## 3. The Learning Journey: Experimental Results

The agent's final successful policy was discovered through an iterative process of diagnosing behavior and refining incentives.

### 3.1 Experiment 1: The Greedy Agent

**Setup:**
- Reward Function: Marginal AEP gain for each new turbine
- Constraint: No penalty for minimum spacing violations

**Result:**
```
Final Layout: All 10 turbines at (0, 0)
AEP: ~10% of theoretical maximum
Status: FAILED
```

**Analysis:**
Classic **reward hacking** problem. The agent exploited a loophole:
- High reward for placing first turbine in empty field
- Agent repeated this action without understanding wake effects
- Failed to learn the devastating impact on total AEP

**Key Insight:** Need explicit constraints to prevent degenerate solutions.

### 3.2 Experiment 2: The Timid Agent

**Setup:**
- Reward Function: Sparse reward (total AEP only at episode end)
- Constraint: Large penalty (-10000) for spacing violations

**Result:**
```
Average Performance: -8000 reward per episode
Typical Layout: 1 turbine successfully placed
Status: FAILED
```

**Analysis:**
Demonstrated the **sparse reward problem**:
- No intermediate feedback to connect actions with outcomes
- Agent learned only from negative penalty signal
- Became too "timid" to explore valid placements

**Key Insight:** Need step-by-step feedback for complex decision sequences.

### 3.3 Experiment 3: Successful 10-Turbine Optimization

**Setup:**
- Reward Function: Marginal AEP gain per valid step + large penalty for violations
- Exploration: Dedicated pure exploration phase (first 1000 steps)
- Configuration: 10 turbines, 4000m × 4000m farm

**Results:**
```
SUCCESS

Final AEP:        157.3 MWh/year
Theoretical Max:  158.1 MWh/year
Efficiency:       99.5%
```

**Learning Curve:**

| Episode | Avg AEP | Efficiency | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| 0-50    | 45 MWh  | 28%        | Random exploration |
| 51-150  | 98 MWh  | 62%        | Learning spacing |
| 151-300 | 142 MWh | 90%        | Optimizing layout |
| 301-500 | 157 MWh | 99%        | Fine-tuning |

**Analysis:**

Success factors:
1. **Immediate Feedback:** Step-wise rewards enabled learning complex trade-offs
2. **Balanced Exploration:** Initial random phase built diverse experience
3. **Proper Incentives:** Combined marginal gains with hard constraints

Layout Characteristics:
- Turbines arranged in staggered rows perpendicular to prevailing wind
- Optimal spacing: 5-7 rotor diameters
- Minimal wake interference in dominant wind directions

### 3.4 Experiment 4: Advanced 20-Turbine Optimization

**Setup:**
- Configuration: 20 turbines (2× complexity), same farm dimensions
- Challenge: Higher density, increased wake interactions

**Results:**
```
REALISTIC OPTIMIZATION

Turbines Placed:  19 (agent chose to stop early)
Final AEP:        284.7 MWh/year
Theoretical Max:  307.5 MWh/year
Efficiency:       92.6%
Training Time:    ~14 hours (1000 episodes)
```

**Performance Metrics:**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Turbines** | 19/20 | Optimal density discovered |
| **Wake Loss** | 7.4% | Excellent for high density |
| **Spacing Violations** | 0 | Perfect constraint satisfaction |
| **Training Stability** | High | Converged by episode 750 |

**Analysis:**

Scientifically valuable result demonstrating:

1. **Practical Constraint Discovery:** Agent learned that 20 turbines exceeded optimal density for the farm size
2. **Quality Over Quantity:** Chose 19 well-placed turbines over 20 poorly placed ones
3. **Realistic Performance:** 92.6% efficiency is excellent for high-density configurations

Layout Insights:
- More complex wake avoidance patterns
- Dynamic spacing based on local wake conditions
- Emergent corridors for wake dissipation

Comparison to Baselines:
- Regular grid: ~78% efficiency
- ATLAS result: **92.6% efficiency**
